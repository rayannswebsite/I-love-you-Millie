    <p class="content">
      I love you so, so much, Millie. I honestly don’t even know where to start because there’s just so much I feel for you. You make me feel so special, so loved, and so important, and I don’t think I could ever fully explain just how much that means to me. Every time we talk or even just think about each other, I feel this happiness and warmth that I’ve never felt with anyone else. You make me feel comfortable being completely myself, and that’s something I can’t even put into words.

Even though we’re miles apart, it feels like you’re right here with me. Your voice, your laugh, your little messages they mean everything to me. I think about you all the time, and honestly, sometimes I just smile for no reason other than thinking about you. You’ve become such a huge part of my life, Millie, and I can’t imagine my days without you.

I love the way you make me feel safe, understood, and completely in love. I love the way you care, the way you notice the little things, and how you somehow make even the hardest days feel lighter just by being you. I’ve never felt this way before, and it’s kind of crazy how much I’ve fallen for you, but I wouldn’t change it for anything in the world.

I wanted to make something for you, like a website, because you deserve to see and feel how much you mean to me every single day. I want you to know that even though we’re far apart, my heart is yours completely, Millie. You’re my happiness, my safe place, my favorite person, and the one I love more than anything. I’ll always love you, and I hope that no matter the distance, you can feel how much of me belongs to you.

You mean the world to me, Millie, and I’ll never stop loving you.
