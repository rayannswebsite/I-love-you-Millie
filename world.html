      it’s crazy to think that’s literally how I met you. If you hadn’t, I probably wouldn’t have found you, and honestly, my life would be completely different. Meeting you changed everything for me, and I can’t even put into words how happy I am that it happened.

Every time I think about that moment, I just smile. It’s kind of wild how something so random ended up being the start of something so amazing. You’ve become such a huge part of my life, Millie. You make me feel loved, comfortable, and completely myself, and I can’t imagine not having you in my life. Even though we’re far apart, I feel like you’re always here with me, and I just love that.

So yeah, I’m super grateful you posted that video because it literally brought you into my life, and now I get to love you, laugh with you, and share everything with you. You mean everything to me, Millie, and I’ll always be thankful for that TikTok moment that started it all.
