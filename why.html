    <p class="content">
      I love you so, so much, Millie. You make me feel so special and truly loved in a way I’ve never felt before. Honestly, I can’t even put into words how much you mean to me, and no matter how hard I try, I feel like it’s never enough. That’s why I decided to make something just for you a website dedicated entirely to you, because you deserve to see and feel how much I adore you every single day.

Even though we’re miles apart, you make me feel so close to you. You make me feel comfortable, safe, and completely myself. Every time I think of you, my heart feels lighter, and I can’t help but smile. I’ve fallen so deeply in love with you, and every little thing you do makes me fall even more. You’re constantly on my mind, in my thoughts, and in my dreams. I just wish I could be there with you right now, holding your hand and showing you in person just how much you mean to me.

Millie, you’re not just someone I love you’re my person, my safe place, and my happiness. I hope this little website can show you even a fraction of the love I feel for you, because you deserve to know just how much of my heart (and biceps hehe) belongs to you, always.
